# JAVE2

The JAVE2 (Java Audio Video Encoder) library is Java wrapper on the ffmpeg
project. Developers can take take advantage of JAVE2 to transcode audio 
and video files from a format to another. In example you can transcode
an **AVI** file to a **MPEG** one, you can change a **DivX** video stream into a
(youtube like) **Flash FLV** one, you can convert a **WAV** audio file to a **MP3** or a
**Ogg Vorbis** one, you can separate and transcode audio and video tracks, you can
resize videos, changing their sizes and proportions and so on.

Many other formats, containers and operations are supported by JAVE2.

## Supported Operating Systems + Requirements 

> JAVE requires **Java 8 or higher**

> JAVE can also be easily ported to other OS and hardware configurations, 
see the JAVE manual for details.

## Usage Example
For the documentation, please have a look at the project wiki pages [**here**](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2/wiki)

or at this file [**DefaultFFMPEGLocatorTest.java**](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2/blob/master/jave-example/src/main/java/ws/schild/jave/example/DefaultFFMPEGLocatorTest.java)


Maven Repository URL -> https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ws.schild/jave-all-deps

### Use with Maven

It includes all binaries for the supported platforms

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ws.schild/jave-all-deps -->
``` XML
<dependency>
 <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
 <artifactId>jave-all-deps</artifactId>
 <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

You can use maven dependencies to include the libraries in your projects.
Include the following in your pom files.
### [ Remember always to check the latest release [here](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2/releases/latest) ]

**Generally if you want to use for one platform or more what you have to do is add the jave-core:**

``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

and then the specific jar(s) for your platform(s) :

### For one platform only (Linux 64Bit amd/intel in this case)
``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-nativebin-linux64</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### For one platform only (Linux 64Bit arm in this case)
``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-nativebin-linux-arm64</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### For one platform only (Linux 32Bit arm in this case)
``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-nativebin-linux-arm32</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### For one platform only (Windows 64Bit in this case)
``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-nativebin-win64</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### For one platform only (MACOS 64Bit in this case)
``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>ws.schild</groupId>
    <artifactId>jave-nativebin-osx64</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Use with Gradle

It includes all binaries for the supported platforms

``` XML
compile group: 'ws.schild', name: 'jave-all-deps', version: '3.0.1'
```

### For one platform only (Linux 64Bit in this case)
``` XML
compile group: 'ws.schild', name: 'jave-core', version: '3.0.1'
compile group: 'ws.schild', name: 'jave-nativebin-linux64', version: '3.0.1'
```

### Main Components of Jave2
Jave2 consists of two main components:
1. The `jave-core` dependency, which includes all the java code, which is platform independent
2. The `jave-nativebin-<platform>` dependencies, which include the binary executables per platform

There exists a jave-all-deps project, which includes core and all windows und linux binaries.

#### Converting any audio to mp3
``` JAVA
boolean succeeded;  
try {                                                         
 File source = new File("file path");		                 
 File target = new File("file path");

 attrs.setAudioAttributes(audio);                            
                                                             
 //Encode                                                    
 Encoder encoder = new Encoder();                            
 encoder.encode(new MultimediaObject(source), target, attrs);
                                                              
} catch (Exception ex) {                                      
 ex.printStackTrace();                                       
 succeeded = false;
